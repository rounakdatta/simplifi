Simplifi empowers the potential of developers with AI. With AI leaving no stone unturned, we wanted to ensure developers to be productive enough within their IDE. We provide a complete suite of IDE (powered by open-source Monaco Text Editor) connected with an Assistant capable enough to query doubts on stackoverflow, fetch the latest Git commits, converse with the developer as a friend. Not only this, we also help the developer take timely breaks helping her/him being at top of her/his health.

The IDE is powered by VueJS and the assistant is Python-based. Also, the modules are Dockerized and deployed on RedHat OpenShift.

The project has two modules - the [Code Editor](https://github.com/rounakdatta/simplifi-code) and the [Assistant](https://github.com/rounakdatta/simplifi-dev-assistant).
